HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard markup language used to create and structure content on the World Wide Web. It provides the framework for web pages, defining how text, images, links, and other media are organized and displayed by web browsers.
Key aspects of HTML:
Markup Language:
HTML uses a system of "tags" and "elements" to annotate text and define its structure and semantics. For example, <p> and </p> tags enclose a paragraph of text, while <img> is used to embed an image.
Structure of Documents:
HTML defines the logical structure of a web page, including headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, forms, and more. This structure helps browsers render the content correctly and makes it accessible for users and search engines.
Elements and Attributes:
HTML documents are composed of elements, which are defined by tags. Elements can have attributes that provide additional information or modify their behavior. For instance, the href attribute in an <a> tag specifies the destination URL of a hyperlink.
Foundation of Web Development:
While HTML provides the structure, it is often used in conjunction with other technologies:
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): Used for styling and visual presentation of HTML elements.
JavaScript: Used to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages.
Evolution:
HTML has evolved through various versions, with HTML5 being the current widely adopted standard. HTML5 introduced new features for multimedia, graphics, and improved semantic elements.
Not a Programming Language:
HTML is a markup language, not a programming language. It describes the content and structure of a document but does not perform computational tasks or define logic like a programming language would.
